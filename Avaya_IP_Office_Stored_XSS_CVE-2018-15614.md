## Description
The One-X Web Portal was vulnerable to multiple persistent or stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. This occurs when JavaScript or HTML code entered as input to a web application is stored within back-end systems, and that code is later used in a dynamically-generated web page without being correctly HTML-encoded.

## Location
Conference Scheduler Service, Add Tab and Add Group functionalities.

## Impact
This vulnerability could allow an authenticated user to perform stored cross site scripting attacks that could affect other application users, as well as capturing a user’s session token or credentials.

If a lower-privileged user were to exploit this vulnerability with a suitable payload, when a user with higher privileges viewed that page the malicious JavaScript code would be executed within the context of the currently authenticated user’s session, resulting in a privilege escalation attack.

## Recommendation
For 10.x, upgrade to 10.1 SP4 or later. For 11.x, upgrade to 11.0 SP1 or later.

According to the vendor, the "Resolution" column at Avaya advisory URL will be updated, as fixes are made available.
